You are reminded of a museum you visited a couple years ago where you spent the day alone, walking f{},rom exhibit to exhibit, your thoughts falling aimlessly from one subject to the next. You used to do things like that more, you think. You don't do things like that much anymore. \n\nA few bodies lie around the courtyard, clearly the leftovers of a skirmish some months past. It is not clear to you if there were any survivors. \n\nThe closest body has a fat-looking pouch upon his belt. You are drawn to it. Do you reach for it now, or spend a little while?",
